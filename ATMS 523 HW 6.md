## Module 6 Project

Submit this code as a pull request back to GitHub Classroom by the date and time listed in Canvas.

## Datasets

Use the Storm Prediction Center tornado dataset https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/data/1950-2021_actual_tornadoes.csv

Also, use the ENSO, PDO, NAO, and AO dataframe from earlier module.

## Your assignment

1) Aggregate the tornado data over the following states into a monthly count of tornadoes:
   
   - Illinois
   
   - Indiana
   
   - Wisconsin
   
   - Michigan
   
   - Missouri
   
   - Iowa
   
   - Minnesota
2. Merge this monthly tornado dataset with the ENSO, PDO, NAO, and AO dataframe created in Module 4 Notebook 1.

3. Create a random forest regression model and use features that include the 4 climate indices to predict the monthly number of tornadoes.  Create a scatter plot of the predicted and observed number of tornadoes over these states.  Report the correlation coefficient and RMSE of your model.

4. Create a one-hot encoding for the month of the year.  Repeat the scatterplot and compare the RMSE and correlation coefficient values.

5. Perform a feature importance and multipass permutation analysis of your features.

6. Create a SHAP Summary Plot showing feature importance and feature effects.

7. Create a SHAP Feature Dependence for the ENSO index.

8. Any observations on the importance of the various features in your model from the XAI techniques you tried?
